<h1>Semiotics of Dress</h1>

<P>Semiotics of Dress addresses the juxtaposition between the concepts of 'dress' and how personal and individual presentation of the self is interpreted by others and a broader society. This project is an exploration of the implications of dresses and skirts within girlhood and womanhood; these garments universally imply notions of freedom, constraint, expectation, and exploitation. Focusing on texture and interaction, this piece comments on psychological aspects regarding presentation of the self in mainstream society's present, past, and future Example: plaster representing fragility, metal and wire representing threat or intimidation, justgirlythings' inclusion representing social conformity driven by trend assimilation.</P>
